# fsharp-discord-bot
A basic template for writing functional discord bots in F#

## How to test it
```
cd fsharp-discord-bot/FsharpDiscordBot
FSHARP_BOT_TOKEN="your token goes here" dotnet run
```

## Q 'n' A

### "that looks like lots of boilerplate"
Yes, this is how it is when using dotnet libs in F#

## "given the boilerplate, why would I want to use F#?"
As your bot grows, code cleanliness becomes more and more important.
The advantages of F# will slowly become much more apparent as your codebase expands.
